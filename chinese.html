          <ol>
          	Cooking Rice
Rinse rice very well till the water runs clear of starch. Soak the rice in enough water for 30 minutes.

Drain and keep aside.
In a pot, bring water to a gentle boil adding salt and oil.
Add the soaked and drained rice to the hot water.
On a low to medium flame cook the rice without the lid.
When the rice becomes al dente or just cooked, remove the pot from fire and strain the rice.
Gently rinse the rice in water so that they stop cooking and don’t stick to each other.
Cover the rice and keep aside. You can even cover and refrigerate the rice.
Making Schezwan Fried Rice

Finely chop all the vegetables. You can even shred the vegetables in a food processor.
Heat oil in a wok. Add garlic and saute for a 15 to 20 seconds.
Add the onions, celery and all the vegetables.
Increase the flame and stir fry the vegetables on a high heat.
More finely the vegetables are chopped, more faster they will cook.
Keep on stirring and tossing the vegetables on a high heat continuously. So that they are equally browned and cooked.
When the edges of the veggies starts to become light brown, add schezwan sauce.

Stir and then add the drained rice in parts. Mix and toss the rice with the veggies gently.
Season with salt, pepper and vinegar. Stir and toss well so that the sauce coats all the rice grains evenly.
Garnish with the spring onions greens.
Serve schezwan fried rice as it is or with a side of veg manchurian, mushroom manchurian or gobi manchurian.

          	Making Vegetable Balls

Take the finely chopped or grated veggies in a bowl. 
Then add the dry ingredients – corn starch, all-purpose flour (maida), black pepper and salt.
Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices. 
Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.
Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.

Make all veggie balls this way and keep aside.
Frying Veggie Balls
Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veg manchurian balls. If the balls break, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all purpose flour (maida).
Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much of oil.
When cooked from one side, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.
Fry the balls till crisp and golden.
Remove them with a slotted or perforated spoon and drain as much as oil as possible.
Place the fried veg manchurian balls on kitchen paper towels. For a low fat version, you can cook the veggie balls in an appe-appam pan or æbleskiver pan.
Fry the veg manchurian balls this way in batches and keep aside.
Making Sauce Or Gravy
In a small bowl take the following three sauces – soy sauce, tomato ketchup and red chilli sauce.
Mix the sauces very well and keep aside.
In another small bowl take 1 tablespoon cornflour and 2 tablespoons water. Mix very well and keep aside.
Heat 1 to 1.5 tablespoons oil in a pan or wok. Add the chopped spring onions, finely chopped ginger, finely chopped garlic, finely chopped green chilies and finely chopped capsicum. Adding capsicum is optional.
Stir fry on medium flame till the onions turn translucent.
Now add the mixed sauces. Stir and mix very well.
Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. Let the mixture come to a boil.
Mix the cornflour paste again in the bowl (as the cornflour settles at the bottom) and then add in the pan.
As soon as you add cornflour paste, mix very well so that there are no lumps.
Continue to stir and mix when the veg manchurian gravy is cooking. Simmer till the sauce thickens and you see a glaze in it. There should be no raw taste of the cornflour in the sauce. Cooking sauce or gravy takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium flame. If the sauce is too thick, then you add some water. If it is too thin, then you can add some cornflour.
When the veg manchurian sauce thickens, add ½ teaspoon black pepper powder.
Season with a bit of salt. Do keep in mind that the soy sauce, chilli sauce and tomato ketchup already has salt in it. So add less salt and as per your taste preferences.
Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar. Mix very well.
Then add the fried veg manchurian balls. Also add 1 teaspoon of Rice vinegar or regular vinegar or apple cider vinegar. 
Gently stir and coat the veg manchurian balls in the gravy.
Switch off the flame add chopped spring onion greens.
Serve veg manchurian hot garnished with some spring onion greens. This manchurian gravy goes well with veg fried rice, plain rice and even bread or the chapati or rotis.

		<h2>Spring Rolls</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/rolls.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
For Stuffing

▢2 tablespoon sesame oil or any oil
▢150 grams cabbage or about 2.25 to 2.5 cups shredded cabbage
▢80 grams carrot or 2 small carrots shredded or ½ cup shredded carrots
▢1 small to medium green bell pepper (capsicum) - thinly sliced or 1/3 cup thinly sliced green bell pepper
▢7 to 8 french beans, sliced very thinly or ¼ cup thinly sliced beans
▢2 to 3 cup small to medium spring onions (scallions) or 1/3 cup spring onions whites
▢½ teaspoon crushed black pepper or black pepper powder or add as per taste
▢1 tablespoon soy sauce
▢1 teaspoon finely chopped celery (optional)
▢1 cup cooked noodles or about 75 grams uncooked noodles (optional)
▢3 tablespoon bean sprouts (optional)

▢2 to 3 tablespoon chopped spring onion greens
▢salt as required
▢oil for deep frying
For The Sealing Paste
▢6 tablespoon all purpose flour or corn starch
▢4 to 5 tablespoon water or add as required to make a thick paste
Other Ingredients
▢24 to 30 spring roll wrappers
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Preparation

First cook 75 grams noodles as per package instructions. Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them.
Once the noodles should be cooked well, then strain the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.
Strain and keep aside.
Chop the veggies in thin long strips. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper/capsicum in thin strips. French beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally. Chopping takes time, so you can also use a food processor to chop the veggies.
Please note you can use your choice of veggies.
Making Stuffing

Now heat 2 tbsp sesame oil in a wok or kadai. Keep the flame on medium intensity and add 1/3 cup spring onion whites.
Stir and then add all the veggies.
Increase the flame to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes on a high flame.
Then add 1/2 tsp crushed black pepper powder and 1 tsp finely chopped celery (optional).
Add 1 tbsp soy sauce. Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.
Stir everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.

Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce already has salt. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.
Switch off the flame and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the filling aside. Let it cool down.
Preparing Sealing Paste
In a bowl, mix 6 tbsp all purpose flour or corn starch and 4 to 5 tbsp water. I used all purpose flour.
Stir very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.
Making Spring Rolls - Method 1
Now take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have posted, then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.
Now with your fingertip, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 tbsp of the veggie stuffing on one side.
Gently but tightly roll till the end.
Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.
Now spread some of the paste on the sides.
Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.
Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges.
Making Spring Rolls - Method 2
Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.
Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.
Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it. 
While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break. If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.
Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.
Deep Frying Spring Rolls
Heat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees celsius). 
Gently slid a spring roll. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.
Depending on the size of the pan or kadai, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.
Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.
Fry till they are crisp and golden. The spring rolls get fried quickly.
Remove them with a slotted spoon.
Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.
Garnish with some chopped spring onion greens and serve veg spring rolls hot with red chili sauce or tomato ketchup.

          	Cooking Noodles

First boil water in a pan with salt and oil.
Add noodles to the boiling water and cook them till they are just cooked or al dente.
While noodles are cooking, rinse and chop the vegetables.
Once noodles are cooked al dente, drain them in a colander or sieve.
Then rinse noodles in fresh water by placing the colander or sieve under fresh tap water.
Drain all the water and set aside.
Making Veg Noodles

Heat oil in a wok or pan.
First add the garlic and ginger and stir fry or sauté on low to medium-low heat for some seconds.
Increase the heat to a high and add the chopped spring onions.
Keep on stirring continuously and stir fry the onions till they become translucent.
Add the veggies – carrots, capsicum and french beans.
Continue to toss and stir fry on a high flame till the veggies are almost cooked.
Use a pan with handles as its better to lift it while tossing.

You can also decrease the flame if the heat becomes too much too handle and then stir fry the veggies on a medium flame.
Some crunch should be there in the vegetables, so don’t cook the vegetables till they become completely soft.
Add the soy sauce, celery, salt and pepper. Mix well.
Add cooked noodles. Keep on tossing and stirring till the veggies are mixed well with noodles for a minute or two. Switch off the heat.
Check the taste and add more salt, black pepper or soy sauce if required to the stir-fried veg noodles.

		<h2>Momos</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/momo.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
For The Dumpling Dough

▢1 cup all-purpose flour – 125 grams
▢½ teaspoon oil
▢¼ teaspoon salt or as required
▢2 to 3 tablespoon water for kneading or as required
For Vegetable Stuffing
▢1 tablespoon oil
▢2 small-sized spring onions (scallions) finely chopped – reserve the greens to be added later
▢½ teaspoon finely chopped garlic or 3 to 4 small-sized garlic, finely chopped
▢1.5 to 1.75 cups finely chopped mix vegetables (I added ½ cup chopped cabbage, ½ cup chopped carrots, ⅓ cup chopped french beans and ¼ cup chopped capsicum)
▢½ cup chopped white button mushrooms – optional

▢1 teaspoon soy sauce or add as required
▢½ teaspoon black pepper powder or as required
▢salt as required
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Making Dough
Take the all-purpose flour, salt, oil in a bowl and mix them well with a spoon.
Add water in parts and knead to a firm dough. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 minutes.
Making Vegetable Stuffing

Finely chop all the vegetables. You can also use a food processor to chop the vegetables.
In a thick bottomed pan heat oil. Add finely chopped garlic. Sauté for 2 to 3 seconds on medium-low heat.
Add spring onion whites and sauté for 10 to 15 seconds on medium-low heat. Then add all the finely chopped vegetables.
Increase the flame and stir fry the vegetables on a medium to high heat. If you have not used a thick bottomed pan, then saute the veggies on a low to medium heat.
Sauté or stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Then add soy sauce, salt and pepper.
Continue to stir fry on a medium to high flame for 2 to 3 minutes more.

Switch off the flame and add the spring onions greens. Mix well.
Check the taste and add more salt, pepper or soy sauce, if required. Set the stuffing aside until it cools completely.
Shaping Momos
Divide the dough in two parts. Make a 7 to 8 inches log from each part. Cut the log into equal slices.
Make ball of each slice and keep them covered with a moist napkin.
Take each dough ball and on a lightly dusted board, roll each dough ball into a thin circle of about 3 to 4 inches in diameter.

Try to get the edges to be thin and the center to be thick.
Place 2 or 3 teaspoons of vegetable stuffing in the center.
Lift one side of the edge and start pleating. (Refer to the video below to see how pleating is done).
Start folding and forming the pleats one by one. Towards the end, join the pleats in the center.
Prepare all momos this way and keep them covered under a moist napkin. Till you are ready to steam them.
Steaming Veg Momos
Heat 1.5 to 2 cups water in a steamer or in an electric cooker or in a pressure cooker. Let the water come to a boil.
In a greased steamer pan or in idli moulds, place the momos keeping some space between them so that they don't touch each other. Check notes on how to steam the momos in idli pan or pressure cooker or Instant Pot.
Steam them for 5 to 6 minutes.
Don't overdo the steaming, as the dough becomes dense and dry.
The steaming time may vary upon the thickness of momos’ cover.
When you touch the momo then dough should not feel sticky to you. This means they are done and the momos will have a transparent look.
Time of cooking varies from intensity of the flame and kind of pan and the steamer you are using.
Once done, remove them and keep on a serving tray or plate. Garnish with spring onion greens.
Serve veg momos with a spicy sauce like schezwan sauce or tomato-chili sauce or chili sauce. You can also serve it with red chilli garlic chutney.
