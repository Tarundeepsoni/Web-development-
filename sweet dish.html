	     <div><img src="images/rasmalai.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
12 to 15 rasgulla, homemade or store brought ones
▢1 litre whole full fat cow milk or 4 cups whole full fat cow milk
▢4 to 5 tablespoon sugar or add as required
▢10 to 12 tablespoon almonds - blanched
▢10 to 12 unsalted pistachios - blanched
▢½ cup water for blanching the almonds and pistachios
▢½ teaspoon cardamom powder
▢1 to 2 teaspoon rose water or kewra water
▢8 to 10 saffron strands
▢a few saffron strands for garnish
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Preparation

To make rasmalai you will need 12 to 15 rasgullas. Either you can buy them from stores or make them at home. 
Boil ½ cup water. Then add almonds & pistachios. Cover and keep aside for 30 to 40 minutes.
After 30 minutes, peel the almonds, pistachios and slice them. Keep aside.
Thickening Milk To Make Rasmalai
When the almonds are blanching, take 1 litre of milk in a thick bottomed pan or kadai.
Bring the milk to a boil on medium flame.

Whilst the milk is coming to a boil, take 2 tbsp milk from the pan in a small bowl. Let this milk
Become warm and then add crushed saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.
Once the milk has come to a boil, then lower the flame and simmer the milk. Collect the floating cream on the sides. Continue to cook this way till the milk is reduced to half.
Keep on collecting the cream which floats on the top and move it to the sides. Also keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the milk does not get scorched at the bottom.
Add sugar and stir well so that the sugar dissolves.
Then add cardamom powder.

Add the sliced almonds & pistachios. Reserve a few almonds & pistachios for garnishing.
Also add the saffron dissolved milk.
Stir again. Keep simmering the reduced milk at a low flame.
Making Rasmalai
Take each rasgulla and with a spatula apply pressure, so the excess sugar syrup is removed from it. You can also press the rasgulla in your palms. Be gentle and don't apply too much of pressure. As then the rasgullas will break. Do this with all the rasgullas.
Now place the rasgulla in the simmering milk and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.

Switch off the flame and then add 1 tsp rose water or kewra water (pandanus extract).
Stir gently. Cover and let the rasmalai come to room temperature. Then chill and serve it garnished with some sliced almonds or pistachios and saffron strands.
You can also serve rasmalai warm or at room temperature.

		<h2><b>Barfi</b></h2>
	     <div><img src="images/barfi.jpg"></div>  
  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
	      	250 grams unsweetened khoya (mawa or dried evaporated milk solids)
▢5 tablespoon sugar or add as required
▢3 to 4 green cardamoms (choti elaichi) - powdered in a small grinder or mortar-pestle. (about ¼ to 1/3 teaspoon of cardamom powder, husks removed)
▢12 to 15 pistachios (pista) - finely chopped
▢12 to 15 almonds (badam) or cashews (kaju) - finely chopped
▢a pinch of saffron (kesar) - optional
▢1 to 1.5 teaspoon milk - optional
▢¼ to 1/3 teaspoon ghee for greasing the pan or tray
          </ul>
       
        <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Preparation For Barfi Recipe

First grate or crumble the unsweetened khoya.
In a small bowl dissolve a few saffron strands in 1 tsp of milk. This is an optional step.
Grease a bit of ghee, on a butter paper lined on a tray or on a thali/tray.
Making Barfi Recipe
Add the grated khoya in a thick bottomed pan.
Begin to cook on a low flame for 2 to 3 minutes stirring often.
Switch off the flame and add sugar.

Stir. Then turn on the flame. The whole mixture's consistency will become smooth and slightly thin, due to the sugar getting melted.
Stir often and continue to cook on a low flame.
When the mixture becomes slightly thick and starts leaving the sides of the pan, as you see in the pic in step number 9, its time for the next step. 
Avoid cooking too much as then the barfi will have a chewy texture. The time taken to get this texture right from the time, sugar is added is about 8 to 9 minutes on a low flame. The time will vary a couple of minutes here and there, depending on the size, type, quality of the pan and intensity of the flame.
Add chopped dry fruits (almonds, pistachios) or your choice of dry fruits. Also add cardamom powder.

Stir and cook for a minute. Switch off the flame.
Setting Burfi
Pour the entire barfi mixture in the greased pan or butter paper.
Spread evenly keeping 1 inch thickness at the edges.
Sprinkle the saffron scented milk on the burfi.
Once the burfi cools down, slice into squares or diamond shapes.
Serve barfi immediately. You can also store them in an airtight box. These barfi stay good for about 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator.

		<h2>Gulab jamun</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/gulab.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
For The Dough

▢1 cup khoya or mawa – 200 grams
▢¾ cup grated paneer – 100 grams of paneer (Indian cottage cheese)
▢3 tablespoon all-purpose flour
▢2 tablespoon fine sooji (rava or semolina)
▢4 green cardamoms – powdered in a mortar-pestle or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder
▢1 tablespoon milk or add as required
▢¼ teaspoon baking powder
▢oil for deep frying – as required
For Sugar Syrup
▢1.75 cups sugar – 250 grams
▢1 cup water

▢1 tablespoon rose water
▢1 tablespoon milk (optional) – read notes
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Making Dough
Take khoya (mawa or evaporated milk) in a bowl. Mash it very well. There should be no lumps. You can also grate and then mash the khoya.
Then add grated paneer, rava (sooji), all purpose flour (maida), baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya. There should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer.

As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamun not so good. The bits and pieces of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamun. They won’t be smooth.
Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don’t knead.
Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.
Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.
Making Sugar Syrup
Dissolve sugar in water. Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.

Add rose water and stir. Keep the sugar solution aside. On cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.
Frying
Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. Lower the flame and wait for a minute. Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.
Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the jamun are evenly browned.
Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.
Making Gulab Jamun

Then place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in batches.
When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the gulab jamun, on a low flame for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun become soft.
Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun increase a bit in size. Don’t overcook as then the jamun can break.
Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.
Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. You can also chill them and serve them cold. Garnish with rose petals or almond slivers.

          	Making Chenna For Sandesh Recipe

Keep the milk to boil.
Line a deep bowl or pan with a muslin or thin cotton napkin.
When the milk beguns boiling, lower the flame. Add lemon juice and stir. when all the milk curdles, switch off the fire.
Pour the entire content in the lined muslin. take the four corners of the muslin in your hands and join together.
The chenna or paneer would be in the muslin. So gather all the curdled paneer together in the muslin and squeeze the whey.
Rinse the chenna with the muslin in running water very lightly. This is to remove the sourness of the lemon juice or vinegar from the paneer.
Place a weight like a stone bowl or a stone pestle on the muslin for 25-30 mins.
Making Sandesh Recipe

Take the paneer in a plate or a tray. Knead with the knuckles of your palms.
Gather the whole mixture at intervals and then again continue to knead till the mixture becomes smooth and less granular.
Add jaggery and sugar and knead for 2 to 3 minutes again.
The jaggery and sugar both will melt and release moisture in the mixture.
Add this mixture to a thick bottomed non stick pan.
With continous stirring cook on a low flame for a total time of 9-10 minutes.
First the sandesh mixture will have a smooth and molten consistency.
Slowly slowly the moisture would begin to dry up and the sandesh mixture would start coming together.
We do not want a dry sandesh mixture.
The paneer should have some moistness and must not have a dense rubbery texture.
Remember the sandesh mixture should have some moistness and not be dry.

Also no oil or fat should be released from the mixture.
Let the sandesh mixture warm or cool and then knead the mixture again to get a smooth consistency.
Shape into round flattened balls or a peda. with a toothpick or fork you can even make designs on the sandesh.
Press some pistachio or almond slices or raisins in the center.
Serve the sandesh immediately or refrigerate and then serve them.
If not serving immediately then refrigerate the sandesh as they get spoiled if you keep them out at room temperature.

		<h2>Rasgulla</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/rasgulla.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
4 cups full fat whole cow's milk or 1 litre full fat whole cow's milk
▢2 to 3 tablespoon lemon juice, add as required
▢2 cups sugar
▢4 cups water or 1 litre water
▢1 tablespoon milk (optional)
▢1 teaspoon sooji (rava or cream of wheat) or all purpose flour or corn starch
▢1 to 2 tablespoon rose water or kewra water or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Making Chenna
Take milk in a pan and keep it to boil on a low to medium flame. 

I used organic cow milk which does not have much fat. If you use buffalo milk, it has too much of fat and makes a thick layer of malai/cream floating on top. You have to remove the thick layer of malai, before you proceed with the making of chenna.
So when the milk is heating up, line a strainer or bowl with a cheese cloth or muslin.
Keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the froth is not formed on top and the base does not get browned or the milk solids get stuck to the bottom.
When the milk comes to a boil, then reduce the flame to its lowest. Add 1 to 3 tbsp lemon juice. First add 1 tbsp lemon juice and stir. If the milk has not curdled completely, then add 1 tbsp more. Keep the lemon juice handy with you.

Depending on the quality of milk, you may need to add 1 to 3 tbsp of lemon juice. Stir after adding the lemon juice. Sometimes I have added 1 tbsp lemon juice and the milk has curdled and sometimes I needed to add 3 tbsp too. Vinegar also can be added instead of lemon juice. 
Another option is curd/yogurt. Add 4 to 5 tbsp of yogurt or more if required. With yogurt you don't need to rinse the chenna in water later.
As soon as the milk curdles, switch off the flame. The milk should curdle completely with the green watery whey. If the milk does not curdle, then add ½ to 1 tbsp of lemon juice more.
Now pour the curdled milk in the cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer or bowl.
Gather the muslin from the sides and rinse the chenna or coagulated milk very well in running water. This brings down the temperature of chenna as well as removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna.

Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.
Place a heavy weight on the chenna for 7 to 8 minutes. You can also hang the chenna for about 30 minutes.
Making Rasgulla Balls
After 7 to 8 minutes, remove the cheesecloth from the chenna. Note that the chenna should not have too much moisture nor be too dry.
Add 1 tsp sooji or rava or semolina. You can also add all purpose flour (maida). Adding either of them helps to bind the mixture. For a gluten free option, add corn starch instead of semolina or all purpose flour.
First mix the sooji with chenna and then begin to knead.

With the heels of your palms mash the chenna and knead. Keep on collecting the chenna from the sides and continue to mash and knead. 
This kneading process is very important and also decides the texture of chenna. When you feel your palms becoming a bit greasy, its time to stop. Just a bit of greasiness is required.
Avoid kneading to an extent where the whole chenna becomes greasy. I kneaded for about 10 minutes as I have very light hands. So depending on the quality of chenna and the pressure you apply while kneading, you can take more or less time. Note that the chenna should just begin to get greasy.
Knead to a smooth ball of chenna.
Now pinch small portions from the chenna and roll them between your palms to a smooth round ball.
Prepare all small balls this way. Cover all the chenna balls with a moist muslin or kitchen towel and keep aside.
Making Sugar Syrup For Rasgulla
In a large pan, take 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water.
You have to use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the rasgulla to cook and increase in size. You can also use a pressure cooker. I used a pan measuring 8.5 inches in diameter and 4.5 in height. A 3.4 litre stainless steel pan.
Keep this pan on stove top and heat the sugar solution. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. I cooked kneaded the chenna and cooked the sugar syrup simultaneously. You can also do this way.
Add 1 tbsp milk and stir. Adding milk helps in removing impurities. If there are no impurities then you don't need to add milk and directly proceed to step 6
Once the sugar solution becomes hot, the impurities begin to float on the top. You can either remove it with a spoon. Or strain the impurities in a cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer.
Now from the purified sugar solution, reserve ½ cup in a cup or mug. This ½ cup of sugar solution we will be adding to the cooking rasgulla.
Reserve another 1 cup of the sugar solution in a serving bowl.
Cooking Rasgulla
The rest of the 2.5 cups of sugar solution you add it back to the large pan and bring it to a boil on a medium high flame.
Slid the rasgulla gently into the sugar solution.
Once all the rasgulla have been added to the sugar solution, shake the pan. Don't stir the rasgulla with a spoon. Just gently shake the pan.
Cover immediately with a lid and let them cook. Keep the flame to a medium or medium high.
After 4 minutes, open the lid and add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Shake the pan. Adding this reserved sugar solution ensures that the temperature & consistency of the sugar solution is maintained and the sugar does not cook to its thread consistencies.
Cover again and continue to cook.
After 4 minutes, again add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Cover and again cook for 2 minutes. I cooked for 10 minutes. The timing will vary depending on the thickness & quality of pan, the depth of the pan and flame intensity.
To Check The Doneness Of Rasgulla
There are two ways. First place the rasgulla in a bowl or cup of water. If the rasgulla sinks to the bottom its cooked. 
Second method is to press a small portion of the rasgulla with your finger. If the pressed portion bounces back to its original shape, its cooked
Once they are cooked, switch off the flame and keep the pan down.
Serving The Rasgulla
Now take each rasgulla with a spoon and place it in the bowl containing the 1 cup of sugar solution. Cover and keep aside.
Let the sugar solution in which the rasgulla were cooked, become warm. Then add this to the serving bowl containing the rasgulla.
Once the whole mixture has cooled down, add 1 to 2 tbsp rose water. 
If you don't have rose water you can also kewra water (pandanus extract) or ½ tsp cardamom powder. Stir gently and allow them to be soaked in the sugar syrup for 30 minutes.
You can serve the rasgulla now or refrigerate them and serve later.

		<h2>Mishti Doi</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/mishti.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
1 litre full fat milk or 4 cups milk
▢175 to 180 grams palm jaggery or ¾ cup finely chopped palm jaggery
▢½ teaspoon cardamom powder
▢2 tablespoons Curd or a yogurt starter
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Boiling Milk
Take 1 litre full fat milk in a heavy kadai or pan. Keep flame to low or medium-low and begin to heat milk.
Stir occasionally when the milk is getting heated. Let the milk come to a boil.

Then continue to simmer the milk on a low to medium-low flame stirring often.
Scrape the dried milk solids from the sides and add to the simmering milk.
Simmer milk till it reduces to ⅓ or ½ of its original volume.
Keep the kadai down and let the milk cool for about 8 to 9 minutes.
Making Mishti Doi
Meanwhile finely chop or grate 175 to 180 grams palm jaggery. You will need ¾ cup finely chopped palm jaggery.
After 8 or 9 minutes, add the chopped palm jaggery. When adding jaggery, the temperature of milk can be 60 to 65 degrees celsius.

Mix very well till all the jaggery is dissolved.
Add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder. Mix well and let the milk become warm.
Check the temperature of milk. It should be warm – meaning if you dip your finger in the milk, your finger should feel comfortably warm but not hot. If you have a cooking thermometer, you can check the temperature. It should be between 40 to 44 degrees celsius.
Now add 2 tablespoons curd.
With a whisk mix very well. The curd should dissolve in the milk. If you want you can even beat the curd before you add.
Setting Mishti Doi

Now pour the doi mixture in earthen or terracotta bowls or earthen handi.
Cover with a lid or seal with aluminium foil.
Keep in a warm place for the mishti doi to set. Mishti doi takes longer to set than curd. the timing will also vary with the temperature in your city. So you can keep for 9 to 24 hours. 
When it is set, then refrigerate. Serve mishti doi with your meals or as a dessert.
