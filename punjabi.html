<li>enough water for soaking rajma</li>
<h4>For Ginger-Garlic-Chilli Paste</h4><br>
<li>3 to 4 garlic cloves – medium-sized</li>
<li>1 inch ginger</li>
<li>1 to 2 green chillies or 1 to 2 Serrano peppers </li>
	<h4>other Ingredients</h4><br>
<li>2 tablespoons butter + 1 tablespoon oil or 3 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>¾ to 1 cup finely chopped onions or 150 grams onions or 1 large onio</li>

<li>1 cup finely chopped tomatoes or 250 grams tomatoes or 3 medium or 2 large tomatoes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)</li>
<li>¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper or hot paprika</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
<li>1 pinch asafoetida (hing) – optional</li>
<li>¼ to ½ teaspoon Garam Masala Powder</li>
<li>1.5 to 2 cups rajma stock (the water which was used to cook the beans) or fresh water</li>
<li>salt as required</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) – optional</li>
<li>2 to 3 tablespoons low fat cream or half and half or 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream – optional</li>
<li>1 to 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves – for garnish, optional</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          <h4>	Soaking</h4><br>

<li>Rinse and soak the rajma (kidney beans) in enough water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.
<li>Next day, discard the water and rinse the beans again in fresh water for a couple of times.
<li>Drain all the water.
<h4>Pressure Cooking</h4><br>
<li>In a 3 litre pressure cooker, take both the soaked rajma and water.
<li>Pressure cook on a medium to high flame for 15 to 20 minutes.
<li>When the rajma is cooking, you can chop the onions, tomatoes etc.

<li>Crush the ginger, garlic and green chillies in a mortar-pestle to a fine or semi-fine texture. Set aside
<li>When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid.
<li>Check if the rajma beans are cooked or not by taking a bite or pressing a few beans.
<li>If the beans are cooked well set aside or drain the beans. Reserve the stock (water) in which the beans were cooked.
<li>If the rajma are not cooked completely, then pressure cook again adding some water if required for some minutes.
<h4>Making Masala</h4><br>

<li>Heat oil + butter in another pot or pan on a low heat. Add cumin first and let them crackle & get browned.</li>
<li>Then add onions and sauté them till they caramelized or golden browned on a medium-low to medium heat.</li>
<li>Take care not to burn them as this will give bitter tones in the curry.</li>
<li>Light browning the onions is also alright.</li>
<li>Keep on stirring the onions while sauteing them, for uniform cooking and also so that they don't get burnt.</li>
<li>Lower the heat and add the crushed ginger-garlic-chili paste. Stir and sauté for 5 to 10 seconds on a low flame until the raw aroma of the ginger and garlic goes away.</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes on medium-low to medium heat until the tomatoes become soft.</li>
<li>Add all the spice powders one by one – turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, asafoetida (hing) and garam masala powder.</li>
<li>On a medium-low heat or medium heat stirring often sauté the whole masala mixture until the fat starts leaving the sides of the masala base.</li>
<li>Using a slotted spoon or a strainer remove the beans and add them to the masala.</li>
<li>You can also strain the cooked rajma first and set it aside as mentioned above. Set the stock also aside.</li>
<li>Stir and sauté for a minute.</li>
<h4>Making Rajma Masala</h4><br>
<li>Take 1.5 to 2 cups from the stock and add to the rajma.</li>
<li>Add salt and stir the whole curry mixture.</li>
<li>On a low heat to medium-low heat simmer without a lid for 10 to 12 minutes or more time until the <li>curry thickens slightly. It should not be watery.</li>
<li>Mash a few rajma beans with the spoon. This helps to thicken the curry.</li>
<li>When the rajma masala has thickened and comes to the right consistency which is neither too thick nor thin, then add the kasuri methi and cream.</li>
<li>Stir & simmer for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Switch off the heat.</li>
<li>Serve rajma masala with steamed basmati rice, jeera rice or naan or roti or paratha. You can garnish with some coriander leaves when serving.</li>

<li>½ teaspoon red chilli powder or cayenne pepper</li>
<li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon Garam Masala Powder</li>
<li>1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing)</li>

<li>1 cup besan (gram flour)</li>

<li>½ teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon Garam Masala Powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
<li>⅔ to ¾ teaspoon salt or add as required</li>
<li>¼ cup water or add as required</li>
<li>mustard oil or sunflower oil or any neutral oil – for shallow frying or deep frying</li>
<h3>
For Kadhi</h3><br>
<li>⅓ cup chopped onions or 1 small to medium onion</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped ginger</li>
<li>¾ to 1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>

<li>8 to 10 fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)</li>

<li>2 dry red chillies – broken and seeds removed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing)</li>
<li>8 to 10 curry leaves or 1 sprig curry leaves</li>
<li>2 tablespoons mustard oil or sunflower oil or any neutral oil</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          <h4>	Making Curd Slurry</h4>
<li>In a bowl take the sour curd and whisk it well till smooth</li>

<li>Add gram flour, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder and salt to the whisked curd.
<li>Stir and mix everything again.</li>
<li>Add 3 cups water and stir again.</li>
<li>Stir very well to make a smooth mixture without lumps. If there are lumps, then break them with a wired whisk or a spatula or with your fingers. Set the curd slurry aside.</li>
<li>You can use a blender to make this mixture, but make sure you don’t over do it. You will get butter instead of a smooth blended curd.</li>
<h3>Making Onion Pakora</h3>

<li>Take the gram flour in a bowl and add carom seeds, red chili powder, garam masala powder and salt.
<li>Add 1 cup thinly sliced onions.</li>
<li> everything well and set aside covered for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>This will allow the onions to release their water in the mixture. Depending on the water content in the onions, the mixture will become very moist or just about moist.</li>
<li>Then accordingly add water as required to make a thick batter. I added ¼ cup water.</li>
<li>Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or kadai. With a spoon or with your hands drop the pakora batter in the oil.</li>
<li>When the pakora are partly cooked, then turn over and fry the other side.</li>
<li>Fry till the pakora are crisp and golden.</li>
<li>Remove the fried pakora and place them on a kitchen paper towel so that extra oil is absorbed. Fry the pakora in batches this way. When done set all of them aside.</li>
<h4>Making Kadhi<h4>
<li>In another pan or kadai, heat mustard oil. Make sure to use a large bottomed pot so that while boiling,the kadhi does not spill.</li>
<li>Add the cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds and asafoetida. Allow the cumin seeds to crackle and the fenugreek seeds to change their color. Fry on a low flame, so that these spices do not get burnt.</li>
<li>Add chopped onion. Stir and sauté for 3 minutes on a low flame.</li>
<li>Then add chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chopped green chillies. Stir and sauté for a minute.</li>
<li>Now add curry leaves, dry red chilies (halved or broken). Stir and sauté for a minute on a low flame.</li>
<li>Then add the curd slurry.</li>
<li>Stir very well.</li>
<li>Increase the flame to medium and bring the kadhi to a boil. Keep on stirring often so that the bottom does not get browned. Time taken to cook kadhi will be around 14 to 16 minutes.</li>
<li>After the kadhi has come to a boil, then lower the flame and simmer for more 6 to 7 minutes. The kadhi will thicken. </li>
<li>If the kadhi becomes too thick, then add some hot water.</li>
<h4>Making Kadhi Pakora</h4>
<li>Now add the onion pakora to the kadhi and stir gently.</li>
<li>Cover with a lid and let the onion pakora be soaked in it for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Lastly sprinkle some garam masala powder.</li>
<li>Serve kadhi pakora with steamed rice or cumin rice, topped with few teaspoonfuls of ghee. You could also have kadhi with roti or paratha.</li>

<li>Add the whole garam masala (spices) - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 large tej patta, 2 inch cinnamon, 2 to 3 cloves, 2 green cardamom and 2 to 3 black peppercorns.
<li>Fry the whole garam masala mentioned above till the oil become fragrant. But don't burn them.
Add the ground paste and saute till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste.
<li>Keep stirring often. Sauté for 8 to 10 minutes or more till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste and the paste thickens and becomes glossy. Stir while sautéing so that the paste does not stick to the pan.
<li>Next add all the dry spice powders - ½ teaspoon turmeric powder (haldi), ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder (dhania powder), 1 pinch asafoetida (optional) and ½ or 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur).
<li>Mix very well and saute for a minute or two. Now add the cooked chickpeas and stir.
<li>Add 1 to 1.5 cups water or add as required. Also add salt as per taste and mix well.
<li>Simmer the gravy on a low or medium flame for 12 to 15 minutes or till the curry thickens. Don't cover the pan. Stir occasionally.
<li>Mash a few chickpeas with the back of spoon. This helps in thickening the gravy.
<li>Lastly add 1 slit green chili and 1 teaspoon garam masala powder or chole masala powder. Mix well and simmer for a minute or two.
<li>Check the seasoning and add more salt or spice powders if required. Garnish the curry with coriander leaves.
<li>You can also garnish with some slit green chilies and ginger julienne.
<li>Serve chickpea curry with onion slices, lemon wedges along with bhatura. Enjoy the chickpea curry with bhature.
Making Bhatura
<li>Using a sieve, sift the maida (all-purpose flour), salt and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Then add the semolina and sugar to the sifted ingredients.
<li>Now to the sifted ingredients, add the curd (yogurt). Mix very well with a spoon.
<li>Adding water in parts first mix and then knead to a smooth and soft dough.
<li>Cover the dough with a wet cotton napkin and let it rest for 2 hours.
<li>After 2 hours, pinch medium-sized balls from the dough.
Roll the dough piece to a neat ball between your palms. Place the dough ball on your work surface and <li>press it lightly with your fingers. Spread a bit of oil on both sides of the dough. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough ball into an oval or elongated shape. You can also make a round circle.
<li>In a pan or kadai heat oil on medium-high heat for deep frying. Drop the rolled dough in hot oil and it will quickly start puffing in the oil.
<li>When the sizzling of the oil stops, turn over the bhatura and fry the other side. You can flip once or twice for even cooking.
<li>When light golden or golden, remove the bhatura and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Roll and fry all bhaturas this way.
<li>Serve the hot puffed up Bhatura with the chickpea curry.

		<h2>Mooli Prantha</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/mooli.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
For Whole Wheat Dough

<li>2 cups whole wheat flour
<li>1 to 2 teaspoons oil or ghee
<li>¼ to ½ teaspoon salt or add as required
<li>water as required to knead
For Radish Stuffing
<li>1 radish white, (mooli, daikon) - medium to large with or without leaves
<li>1 or 2 green chilies finely chopped
<li>red chilli powder as required - or cayenne pepper or paprika
<li>salt as needed
<li>Garam Masala Powder - optional
<li>Ghee (clarified butter) or oil for roasting
<li>white butter to serve with the paratha
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Preparation

<li>Knead whole wheat dough with the flour, salt, oil adding water as needed until soft and pliable. Set it aside.
<li>Grate the mooli (radish) and set aside for 15 to 20 minutes and later squeeze the water from it. 
<li>This is done so that the mooli paratha do not break while rolling the dough. This radish juice can be used to make the dough instead of water.
<li>Add chopped green chilies to the grated mooli.
Rolling Mooli Paratha
<li>Now take two lemon sized ball from the dough and roll them into a small circle, about 5 to 6 cms on the rolling board dusted with wheat flour.

<li>Take a good amount of the mooli stuffing and place it on one of the rolled dough. 
<li>Don't use too much stuffing as in that case the mooli parathas can break while rolling.
<li>Sprinkle evenly one or two pinch of salt, red chilli powder and garam masala powder. Cover with the other rolled round and join the edges.
<li>In the meantime, heat the griddle or tava. Roll the dough into the size of a paratha or roti. 
<li>Care should be taken while rolling the dough as the paratha may break.
<li>We have added salt to the mooli and thus as a result some juice will start oozing out from the mooli paratha. Its ok.
Making Mooli Paratha

<li>Heat a tawa (skillet) and place the paratha on the tawa. The tawa should be medium hot. Also keep the flame to medium-high to high. Don't roast the paratha on a low flame. Roasting paratha on a low flame can make them hard or dense and you won't get a good taste.
<li>Fry the paratha on a hot tava or griddle using ghee and oil. 
<li>Use a liberal amount of ghee or oil to fry the paratha. A well-fried paratha will have some brown spots and might puff up little.
<li>Make sure that the paratha edges are fried well. You can use spatula to press them.
<li>You can flip the paratha a couple of times till you see brown spots and the paratha is cooked evenly. The paratha should become golden and crisp from both sides. Make all parathas this way.

<li>Serve Punjabi Mooli Paratha hot with butter or curd or the pickle of your choice. You can also pack them in a lunch box. I love to have these paratha with plain curd or as an evening snack with a cup of hot tea.

	     <div><img src="images/dalmakhni.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
<li>¾ cup whole urad dal , 140 grams (whole black gram)</li>
<li>¼ cup rajma , 40 grams (kidney beans)</li>
<li>3 cups water for pressure cooking , 750 ml water</li>
<li>½ cup finely chopped onions , 50 grams onion or 1 medium sized onion</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chopped green chilies or serrano peppers or 1 to 2 green chillies</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Ginger-Garlic Paste or 6 to 7 small to medium-sized garlic + 1 inch ginger – c<li>ushed to a paste in mortar-pestle</li>
<li>2 large tomatoes , 200 grams tomatoes – pureed or 1 cup tomato puree</li>
<li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>2 to 3 cloves</li>
<li>2 to 3 green cardamoms</li>
<li>1 black cardamom</li>
<li>1 inch cinnamon</li>

<li>1 small to medium tej patta (Indian bay leaf)</li>
<li>½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper or smoked paprika</li>
<li>2 to 3 pinches grated nutmeg or ground nutmeg powder</li>
<li>1 cup water or add as required</li>
<li>¼ to ⅓ cup low fat cream or half and half or 2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) – optional</li>
<li>3 tablespoon butter – salted or unsalted</li>
<li>salt as required</li>

<h4>For Garnish</h4><br>

<li>1 to 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)</li>
<li>½ tablespoon low fat cream or half and half for garnish – optional</li>
<li>1 inch ginger julienne – option</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          <li>	Soak both the whole urad dal and rajma overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight. Later drain them well.</li>
<li>Rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.</li>
<li>Drain again and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water and stir well.</li>

<li>Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more.</li>
T<li>he urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for rajma too. Keep the cooked beans aside.</li>
<li>In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a smooth puree. Set aside.</li>
<li>You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes while pureeing.</li>
<h4>Making Dal Makhani</h4><br>
<li>In a pan, now heat butter. You can use salted butter or unsalted butter.
</li>
A<li>dd the whole spices – cumin seeds, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamom, 1 inch cinnamon, 1 small to medium tej patta.</li>
<li>Fry for some seconds till the spices sputter and become aromatic.</li>
<li>Add finely chopped onions.</li>
<li>Stir and sauté the onions on a low or medium-low heat often till they become light golden.
<li>Add the ginger garlic paste. Stir again and sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
<li>Add the chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.</li>
<li>Add the prepared tomato puree and mix well.</li>
<li>Add red chili powder and 2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder.</li>
<li>Stir very well and sauté this mixture on a low to medium flame, till you see fat releasing from the sides.</li>
<li>Then add the cooked urad dal and rajma beans along with the stock. Also add 1 cup water or as required.</li>
<h4>Slow Cooking</h4><br>
<li>Stir very well and simmer the dal makhani uncovered on a low flame.</li>
<li>Keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don’t stuck to the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Once it has begun to thicken, add salt as required.</li>
<li>Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low flame. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmered on low heat.</li>
<li>When simmering you can add more water if the gravy looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.</li>
<li>I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low flame. Do keep on stirring at intervals.</li>
<li>When the gravy has thickened enough, then add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.</li>
<li>Mix the cream very well. Then switch off the heat.</It>
<li>Add crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). Mix again.</li>
