          	Making Bhel Puri
Assemble everything before you begin. Keep the chutneys in a bowl. These chutneys stay well for about a week in the fridge. So you can keep the leftovers in the fridge.
In a bowl now take the chopped boiled potatoes, onions and tomatoes. You can also include some boiled moong beans or steamed moong bean sprouts at this step.
Add sweet chutney, green chutney and red chutney. You can add the amount of chutneys as per the taste you want in a bhel puri.
Sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon chaat masala and ½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder. Also add some black salt as per taste. If you do not have black salt, then use pink salt, rock salt or white salt.
Drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon lemon juice or according to taste. Mix very well.
Now top with 1 tablespoon masala chana (optional) and 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts. At this step you can also add some crushed puri or papdi. 
Add the puffed rice and cup sev (fried gram flour vermicelli).
With a spoon, just swirl the whole bhelpuri mixture together well and be quick.
Serve bhel puri immediately in individual bowls or plates. Top up with some sev and more coriander leaves if you want. If you don’t serve bhelpuri immediately then it will become soggy and you won’t enjoy it. So be quick in serving.

          	Making Pav Bhaji
Switch on the instant pot. Press the sauté button on less mode. Add 2 tablespoons butter in the ip steel insert.
When the butter melts, add cumin seeds and let them splutter and change color. Then add finely chopped onions and sauté onions till they soften.
Next add the ginger-garlic paste and green chillies. Mix and sauté for a few seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
Then add chopped tomatoes and chopped capsicum. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.Add the chopped veggies and green peas.
Add ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and 1 to 1.5 teaspoons kashmiri red chilli powder. If using any other red chili powder or cayenne pepper, then you can add less of it. Also, add salt as per taste.
Mix everything very well. Add water and stir.
Press the cancel button. Now press the pressure cooker/manual button and set time to 7 minutes on high pressure.
When the beep sound is heard and the pressure cooking is complete, do a quick pressure release (qpr). When all the pressure is released, open the lid. 
Using a napkin or oven mittens, remove the steel insert from the instant pot. Place it on your kitchen counter.
With a potato masher, begin to mash the cooked vegetables. Mash very well. You can even use an immersion blender and puree the veggies. Just make a semi-fine puree.
Now add 2 tablespoons pav bhaji masala and 1 to 2 tablespoons butter. You can skip the butter if you want. Mix very well.
Place the steel insert pan in the IP. Press the cancel button and then press the sauté button on normal mode. Set the timer to 3 to 5 minutes or more.
Simmer the bhaji for a few minutes, till it thickens a bit and you get the desired consistency. Stir often, so that the bhaji does not stick to the bottom. If the bhaji looks very thick, then add some water.
Sprinkle 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Mix very well. Do check the taste and add salt, butter, kashmiri red chili powder or pav bhaji masala if required. Cancel and keep the IP on warm mode.
Toasting Pav (Dinner Rolls)
Heat a skillet or a shallow frying pan. Keep the flame to a low and then add butter.
When the butter begins to melt, add a bit of pav bhaji masala. You can skip pav bhaji masala if you want.
Mix the pav bhaji masala very well with a spoon or spatula.
Then place the pav on the butter.
Rotate the pav all over the melted butter so that the pav absorbs the butter.
Now turn over the pav and rotate them on the tawa so that the second side absorbs the butter. Add more butter if required.
You can turn over and toast them more if required. Then remove in a plate and keep aside.
