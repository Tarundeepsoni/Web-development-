	     <div><img src="images/idli.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
▢1 cup regular rice + 1 cup parboiled rice or 2 cups idli rice or 2 cups parboiled rice
▢½ cup whole or split urad dal or 120 grams whole or split urad dal (husked black gram)
▢¼ cup thick poha or 20 grams thick poha (flattened rice)
▢¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)
▢2 cups water for soaking rice
▢1 cup water for soaking urad dal
▢½ cup water for grinding urad dal or add as required
▢¾ to 1 cup water for grinding rice or add as required
▢1 teaspoon rock salt or sendha namak (edible and food grade) or sea salt
▢oil as required to apply to the idli moulds
▢2.5 cups water for steaming idli
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Soaking Rice And Dal

Pick and rinse both the regular rice and parboiled rice.
Rinse the poha and add to the rice.
Add water. Mix well. Cover and keep the rice + poha to soak for 4 to 5 hours.
In a separate bowl, rinse the urad dal and methi seeds a couple of times.
Soak the urad dal with methi seeds separately in water for 4 to 5 hours.
Making Idli Batter
Drain the soaked urad dal. Reserve the water.

Grind the urad dal, methi seed with ¼ cup of the reserved water for some seconds. Then add remaining ¼ cup water. Grind till you get a smooth and fluffy batter.
Remove the urad dal batter in a bowl and keep aside.
Grind the rice in batches to make a smooth batter.
Mix both the batters together in a large bowl or pan. Add salt and mix well.
Cover and let the batter ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more if required.
After the fermentation process is over, the idli batter will become double in size and rise.
Steaming Idli
Grease the idli moulds.

Pour the batter in the moulds and steam the idli in a pressure cooker or steamer.
If using pressure cooker remove the vent weight (whistle).
Steam for 12 to 15 mins or until the idli is done.
Serve the steaming hot idli with coconut chutney and sambar.
Remaining batter can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.

		<h2><b>Mendu Vada</b></h2>
	     <div><img src="images/mendu.jpg"></div>  
  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
	      2 cups urad dal (husked & split black gram)
▢1 teaspoon cumin seeds
▢1 teaspoon black peppercorns, whole or crushed (optional)
▢1 or 2 sprig curry leaves, chopped
▢1 medium onion, finely chopped (optional)
▢1 or 2 green chilies, chopped
▢1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger
▢⅓ cup chopped coconut pieces, optional
▢few sprigs of coriander leaves, chopped (optional)
▢salt to taste
▢oil for deep frying
▢some water if needed to grind the batter

          </ul>
       
        <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
Making Medu Vada Batter

Soak the urad dal for 4 hours or overnight.
Grind the soaked dal to a smooth batter with little water if required.
If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour to it. Otherwise also you could add some semolina to the batter.
Add the spices, herbs, onions and salt. Mix well.
Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your hands. take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape.
With your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or zip lock bags to give the medu vada its doughnut shape.
Making Medu Vada

In a kadai heat oil. Keep the flame to medium. 
Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada into the hot oil.
Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.
Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. Very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then also the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.
Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.

Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil.
Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney.

		<h2>Upma</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/upma.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
1 cup fine rava (sooji or semolina or cream of wheat)
▢2 tablespoon Ghee or oil
▢1 teaspoon mustard seeds
▢1 teaspoon cumin seeds
▢1 teaspoon urad dal (husked split black gram)
▢1 teaspoon chana dal (husked split bengal gram)
▢1 or 2 dry red chilies - broken and deseeded
▢1 pinch asafoetida (hing)
▢50 grams onion or 1 medium onion, chopped or ⅓ cup chopped onions
▢150 grams tomatoes or 2 medium to large tomatoes or ¾ cup chopped tomatoes
▢1 or 2 green chilies - chopped

▢½ inch ginger - chopped or 1 teaspoon chopped ginger
▢6 to 7 curry leaves - chopped
▢¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
▢¼ to ½ teaspoon red chilli powder - can also add vangi bath powder or bisi bele bath powder
▢2.5 cups water
▢salt as required
▢1 to 2 teaspoon Ghee (clarified butter) for drizzling on top - optional
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Roasting Rava

Heat a pan or kadai first. Add 1 cup rava or cream of wheat.
On a low flame, begin to roast the rava. Stir often while roasting the rava.
The rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start to look dry, separate and crisp. Don't brown the rava.
Switch off the flame and then add the roasted rava in a plate and keep aside.
Making Tomato Upma
In a pan, heat 2 tbsp ghee or oil. add 1 tsp mustard seeds.
When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds, it means they are getting cooked.

When the mustard seeds are crackling, then reduce the flame to a low and add 1 tsp cumin seeds along with 1 tsp chana dal and 1 tsp urad dal.
Stir and saute them on a low flame till the both the urad dal and chana dal become golden. Take care not to burn the dals.
Now add 1 or 2 dry red chilies and a pinch of asafoetida. Stir well.
Add 1/3 cup chopped onions.
Stir and begin to saute the onions on a low to medium flame till they turn translucent.
Then add the chopped green chilly, ginger, curry leaves. Saute for half a minute.

Add 3/4 cup chopped tomatoes,1/4 tsp turmeric powder and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp red chilli powder. You can also add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp vangi bath powder or bise bele bath powder instead of red chilli powder.
Mix very well and saute the tomatoes on a low to medium flame till the tomatoes soften.
Next add 2.5 cups water to this mixture.
Add salt as per taste. Check the taste of water and it should be slightly salty.
On a medium to high flame, heat the water and let it come to a rolling boil.
When the water comes to a rolling boil, lower the flame to its lowest. Then add the rava in 4 to 5 batches directly from the plate or with a spoon.
As soon as you add the first batch, immediately stir and mix very well.
Then add the next batch of rava.
Stir again. This way keep on adding and stirring the rava up to the last batch.
Quickly stir and mix well so that lumps are not formed. The rava grains absorb water and thus swell and get cooked.
Cover and allow the tomato upma to steam for 2 to 3 minutes on the low flame. Then switch off the flame.
Lastly add about 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves. Stir well.
Drizzle 1/2 tsp of ghee on each serving and serve tomato upma hot with coconut chutney or lemon pickle or lemon wedges.

		<h2>Rava Dosa</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/rava dosa.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
½ cup unroasted fine rava (suji or fine semolina)
▢½ cup rice flour
▢¼ cup all-purpose flour
▢1 to 2 green chillies, chopped
▢1 medium sized onion, finely chopped
▢½ inch ginger, finely chopped
▢8 to 10 curry leaves, chopped
▢1 to 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro leaves) – optional
▢½ teaspoon crushed black pepper
▢½ teaspoon cumin seeds
▢2 to 2.5 cups water or add as required
▢salt as required

▢oil or ghee or butter for cooking, as required
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Making Batter
Take unroasted fine rava, rice flour and maida in a bowl.
Add the chopped onions, chopped green chilies ginger.
Also add crushed black pepper, cumin seeds, chopped curry leaves and salt as required.

Add water. Depending on the quality of rava and rice flour, you can add less or more water – from 2 to 2.5 cups water. I added 2.25 cups water.
Whisk till smooth without any lumps. The batter has to be flowing and thin. 
If the batter looks thick or has a medium consistency, then add more water. If the batter looks very thin and runny, then add some rice flour.
Cover and let the suji dosa batter rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the batter rests, you will see that the rava and the flours have settled down and the water will be floating on top.
Making Rava Dosa
Before preparing dosa, mix the batter very well. Spread some oil on the tawa. Do make sure that the tawa is hot.

With a ladle pour the dosa batter. Start from the edges move towards the center.
If there are big or small gaps, then fill them lightly with the batter.
On a medium-low to medium flame, cook the suji ka dosa.
When the top side looks cooked, then sprinkle ½ to 1 teaspoon oil on the top and sides.
Spread oil all over the dosa with a spoon.
Rava dosa takes a little longer time to cook than regular dosa.
Cook till the base is golden and crisp.

The more you cook the rava dosa and the more golden it becomes, the more crisp it will be. Flip and cook the second side for ½ to 1 minute.
Fold and then serve suji ka dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar. 
The flours settles down at the bottom of the batter. So you have to stir and mix the batter very well every time you make dosa. In case the batter becomes thick after making a few dosa, then add some water and stir again.
Serve rava dosa with coconut chutney or dosa podi or any chutney of your choice.
