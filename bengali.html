▢2 tablespoon palm jaggery or substitute with just 2 tablespoon sugar
▢3 tablespoon sugar or as required
▢4 to 5 pistachios (pista), almonds (badam), sliced or 10-12 golden raisins (kishmish)

          	Making Chenna For Sandesh Recipe

Keep the milk to boil.
Line a deep bowl or pan with a muslin or thin cotton napkin.
When the milk beguns boiling, lower the flame. Add lemon juice and stir. when all the milk curdles, switch off the fire.
Pour the entire content in the lined muslin. take the four corners of the muslin in your hands and join together.
The chenna or paneer would be in the muslin. So gather all the curdled paneer together in the muslin and squeeze the whey.
Rinse the chenna with the muslin in running water very lightly. This is to remove the sourness of the lemon juice or vinegar from the paneer.
Place a weight like a stone bowl or a stone pestle on the muslin for 25-30 mins.
Making Sandesh Recipe

Take the paneer in a plate or a tray. Knead with the knuckles of your palms.
Gather the whole mixture at intervals and then again continue to knead till the mixture becomes smooth and less granular.
Add jaggery and sugar and knead for 2 to 3 minutes again.
The jaggery and sugar both will melt and release moisture in the mixture.
Add this mixture to a thick bottomed non stick pan.
With continous stirring cook on a low flame for a total time of 9-10 minutes.
First the sandesh mixture will have a smooth and molten consistency.
Slowly slowly the moisture would begin to dry up and the sandesh mixture would start coming together.
We do not want a dry sandesh mixture.
The paneer should have some moistness and must not have a dense rubbery texture.
Remember the sandesh mixture should have some moistness and not be dry.

Also no oil or fat should be released from the mixture.
Let the sandesh mixture warm or cool and then knead the mixture again to get a smooth consistency.
Shape into round flattened balls or a peda. with a toothpick or fork you can even make designs on the sandesh.
Press some pistachio or almond slices or raisins in the center.
Serve the sandesh immediately or refrigerate and then serve them.
If not serving immediately then refrigerate the sandesh as they get spoiled if you keep them out at room temperature.

		<h2>Rasgulla</h2>
	     <div><img src="images/rasgulla.jpg"></div>  
	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
4 cups full fat whole cow's milk or 1 litre full fat whole cow's milk
▢2 to 3 tablespoon lemon juice, add as required
▢2 cups sugar
▢4 cups water or 1 litre water
▢1 tablespoon milk (optional)
▢1 teaspoon sooji (rava or cream of wheat) or all purpose flour or corn starch
▢1 to 2 tablespoon rose water or kewra water or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Making Chenna
Take milk in a pan and keep it to boil on a low to medium flame. 

I used organic cow milk which does not have much fat. If you use buffalo milk, it has too much of fat and makes a thick layer of malai/cream floating on top. You have to remove the thick layer of malai, before you proceed with the making of chenna.
So when the milk is heating up, line a strainer or bowl with a cheese cloth or muslin.
Keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the froth is not formed on top and the base does not get browned or the milk solids get stuck to the bottom.
When the milk comes to a boil, then reduce the flame to its lowest. Add 1 to 3 tbsp lemon juice. First add 1 tbsp lemon juice and stir. If the milk has not curdled completely, then add 1 tbsp more. Keep the lemon juice handy with you.

Depending on the quality of milk, you may need to add 1 to 3 tbsp of lemon juice. Stir after adding the lemon juice. Sometimes I have added 1 tbsp lemon juice and the milk has curdled and sometimes I needed to add 3 tbsp too. Vinegar also can be added instead of lemon juice. 
Another option is curd/yogurt. Add 4 to 5 tbsp of yogurt or more if required. With yogurt you don't need to rinse the chenna in water later.
As soon as the milk curdles, switch off the flame. The milk should curdle completely with the green watery whey. If the milk does not curdle, then add ½ to 1 tbsp of lemon juice more.
Now pour the curdled milk in the cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer or bowl.
Gather the muslin from the sides and rinse the chenna or coagulated milk very well in running water. This brings down the temperature of chenna as well as removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna.

Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.
Place a heavy weight on the chenna for 7 to 8 minutes. You can also hang the chenna for about 30 minutes.
Making Rasgulla Balls
After 7 to 8 minutes, remove the cheesecloth from the chenna. Note that the chenna should not have too much moisture nor be too dry.
Add 1 tsp sooji or rava or semolina. You can also add all purpose flour (maida). Adding either of them helps to bind the mixture. For a gluten free option, add corn starch instead of semolina or all purpose flour.
First mix the sooji with chenna and then begin to knead.

With the heels of your palms mash the chenna and knead. Keep on collecting the chenna from the sides and continue to mash and knead. 
This kneading process is very important and also decides the texture of chenna. When you feel your palms becoming a bit greasy, its time to stop. Just a bit of greasiness is required.
Avoid kneading to an extent where the whole chenna becomes greasy. I kneaded for about 10 minutes as I have very light hands. So depending on the quality of chenna and the pressure you apply while kneading, you can take more or less time. Note that the chenna should just begin to get greasy.
Knead to a smooth ball of chenna.
Now pinch small portions from the chenna and roll them between your palms to a smooth round ball.
Prepare all small balls this way. Cover all the chenna balls with a moist muslin or kitchen towel and keep aside.
Making Sugar Syrup For Rasgulla
In a large pan, take 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water.
You have to use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the rasgulla to cook and increase in size. You can also use a pressure cooker. I used a pan measuring 8.5 inches in diameter and 4.5 in height. A 3.4 litre stainless steel pan.
Keep this pan on stove top and heat the sugar solution. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. I cooked kneaded the chenna and cooked the sugar syrup simultaneously. You can also do this way.
Add 1 tbsp milk and stir. Adding milk helps in removing impurities. If there are no impurities then you don't need to add milk and directly proceed to step 6
Once the sugar solution becomes hot, the impurities begin to float on the top. You can either remove it with a spoon. Or strain the impurities in a cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer.
Now from the purified sugar solution, reserve ½ cup in a cup or mug. This ½ cup of sugar solution we will be adding to the cooking rasgulla.
Reserve another 1 cup of the sugar solution in a serving bowl.
Cooking Rasgulla
The rest of the 2.5 cups of sugar solution you add it back to the large pan and bring it to a boil on a medium high flame.
Slid the rasgulla gently into the sugar solution.
Once all the rasgulla have been added to the sugar solution, shake the pan. Don't stir the rasgulla with a spoon. Just gently shake the pan.
Cover immediately with a lid and let them cook. Keep the flame to a medium or medium high.
After 4 minutes, open the lid and add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Shake the pan. Adding this reserved sugar solution ensures that the temperature & consistency of the sugar solution is maintained and the sugar does not cook to its thread consistencies.
Cover again and continue to cook.
After 4 minutes, again add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Cover and again cook for 2 minutes. I cooked for 10 minutes. The timing will vary depending on the thickness & quality of pan, the depth of the pan and flame intensity.
To Check The Doneness Of Rasgulla
There are two ways. First place the rasgulla in a bowl or cup of water. If the rasgulla sinks to the bottom its cooked. 
Second method is to press a small portion of the rasgulla with your finger. If the pressed portion bounces back to its original shape, its cooked
Once they are cooked, switch off the flame and keep the pan down.
Serving The Rasgulla
Now take each rasgulla with a spoon and place it in the bowl containing the 1 cup of sugar solution. Cover and keep aside.
Let the sugar solution in which the rasgulla were cooked, become warm. Then add this to the serving bowl containing the rasgulla.
Once the whole mixture has cooled down, add 1 to 2 tbsp rose water. 
If you don't have rose water you can also kewra water (pandanus extract) or ½ tsp cardamom powder. Stir gently and allow them to be soaked in the sugar syrup for 30 minutes.
You can serve the rasgulla now or refrigerate them and serve later.

	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
2 cups all purpose flour
▢2 tablespoon Ghee or 2.5 tablespoon oil
▢water as required
▢salt as required
▢ghee or oil for deep frying
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Preparing Dough For Luchi

In a bowl or a large plate (tray) first add the flour, ghee and salt.
Add 1 or 2 tbsp water and mix everything with your hands or with a spatula.
Then add about 1/2 cup of water and begin to knead the flour.
Add water as required and knead very well. The dough should be soft and smooth.
Cover the dough with a moist kitchen napkin and let it rest for minimum 30 minutes at room temperature.
Rolling And Frying Luchi
Make lemon sized balls from the dough and cover them with the moist napkin.
Apply some oil on the balls, roll each into a circle of about 3-4 inches.
Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil has to become hot.

Drop a small piece of the dough in the oil and if it comes up steadily from the bottom, it means the oil is ready for the luchi to be fried.
Gently drop the dough circle into the hot oil. The luchi will begin to puff up.
Gently nudge with a spoon to help in the complete puffing up of the luchi.
When one side has become creamish and the oil has stopped sizzling, turn over and fry the other side.
Remove and drain on kitchen towels for the extra oil to be soaked.
Serve hot with aloor dum, chola dal or any bengali vegetable or lentil curry.

	   	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
1 litre full fat milk or 4 cups milk
▢175 to 180 grams palm jaggery or ¾ cup finely chopped palm jaggery
▢½ teaspoon cardamom powder
▢2 tablespoons Curd or a yogurt starter
          </ul>
          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Boiling Milk
Take 1 litre full fat milk in a heavy kadai or pan. Keep flame to low or medium-low and begin to heat milk.
Stir occasionally when the milk is getting heated. Let the milk come to a boil.

Then continue to simmer the milk on a low to medium-low flame stirring often.
Scrape the dried milk solids from the sides and add to the simmering milk.
Simmer milk till it reduces to ⅓ or ½ of its original volume.
Keep the kadai down and let the milk cool for about 8 to 9 minutes.
Making Mishti Doi
Meanwhile finely chop or grate 175 to 180 grams palm jaggery. You will need ¾ cup finely chopped palm jaggery.
After 8 or 9 minutes, add the chopped palm jaggery. When adding jaggery, the temperature of milk can be 60 to 65 degrees celsius.

Mix very well till all the jaggery is dissolved.
Add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder. Mix well and let the milk become warm.
Check the temperature of milk. It should be warm – meaning if you dip your finger in the milk, your finger should feel comfortably warm but not hot. If you have a cooking thermometer, you can check the temperature. It should be between 40 to 44 degrees celsius.
Now add 2 tablespoons curd.
With a whisk mix very well. The curd should dissolve in the milk. If you want you can even beat the curd before you add.
Setting Mishti Doi

Now pour the doi mixture in earthen or terracotta bowls or earthen handi.
Cover with a lid or seal with aluminium foil.
Keep in a warm place for the mishti doi to set. Mishti doi takes longer to set than curd. the timing will also vary with the temperature in your city. So you can keep for 9 to 24 hours. 
When it is set, then refrigerate. Serve mishti doi with your meals or as a dessert.

315 grams potatoes or 1 extra large potato or 3 medium potatoes
▢½ teaspoon red chilli powder
▢½ teaspoon turmeric powder
▢salt as required
▢2 to 3 tablespoons mustard oil
▢3 to 4 tablespoons rice flour - optional

          <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins></h3>
          <ol>
          	Instructions
Rinse and then peel one extra large potato or 3 medium potatoes (315 grams). Cut in slices of 0.3 cm to 0.4 cm. Also heat a tawa or frying pan with 1 to 2 tablespoon oil in it.

Take the potato slices in a mixing bowl. Add ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and salt as required.
Mix very well.
Immediately place the potato slices in the hot oil. Fry on medium low to medium flame. Add less oil as potatoes absorb more oil.
When one side is lightly crisp, turn over and fry the second side.
Flip again and a couple of times and fry till the potato slices are crisp and golden. This way fry in batches and add more oil if required. Overall I used 2.5 tablespoons mustard oil for frying.
Remove each fried slice and place on kitchen paper towels for the extra oil to be absorbed.

Alternatively, you can also dredge the potato slices in some rice flour and then fry. This way the potato bhaja becomes more crisp and less oil is absorbed. Sometimes I follow this method also.
Serve aloo bhaja hot or warm as a side dish with khichdi, dal-rice, curd rice or rasam-rice.

          	Making Koraishutir Kochuri Dough
In a bowl add the flour, salt and ghee or oil.

Mix everything so as to incorporate the ghee or oil through the whole flour.
Add water in intervals and knead to a smooth and soft dough.
Cover the dough with a wet napkin and keep aside for 30-45 minutes at room temperature.
Making Matar Stuffing
Rinse the shelled or frozen matar (green peas).
Take them in a grinder or blender. grind to a semi coarse consistency without adding any water.
If not able to grind in your mixer or grinder, then add 1 or 2 tsp of water.

Peel the cardamom and powder the seeds in a mortar-pestle till finely ground.
Heat oil in a small pan.
On a low flame, add all the spice powders one by one - cumin powder, cardamom powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder and asafoetida. fry for 2-3 seconds.
Then add the ground peas (matar), sugar and salt. saute for 3 minutes. Stir continuously.
Add the besan or gram flour and saute for a further 2-3 minutes with continuous stirring.
Take the matar stuffing in a bowl or plate and let it cool.

Prepare small balls from the stuffing and keep aside.
Rolling And Stuffing Koraishutir Kochuri
Before making the kachoris, heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.
Make lemon sized balls from the dough and cover with a wet kitchen napkin.
Take one ball and flatten it with your palm. apply some oil to it on both sides.
Place the ball on the rolling board and roll to a 3 inches diameter circle.
Keep the matar stuffing in the center. bring all the edges of the dough and press them together.
Apply some more oil if required and roll the stuffed kachori to a circle of 4 to 5 inches circle.
If the dough tears, then patch that spot with a small piece of dough and roll on that part gently to even it.
Frying Koraishutir Kochuri
Drop a small piece of dough in the oil and if it comes steadily from the bottom to the top, then the oil is hot enough for the kachoris to be fried.
Gently drop the kachori in the hot oil.
With a slotted spoon, apply gentle pressure on the kachori to help it to puff up, like we do while frying pooris.
When one side is done and all puffed up - you will see that the oil has stopped sizzling.
Turn over and fry the other side of matar kachori.
You can turn over twice and fry for a few seconds too.
When the koraishutir kochuri appears crisp and pale creamish golden, remove from the slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper towels.
Serve koraishutir kochuri plain or with yogurt or any chutney or with aloor dum

          	Preparation For Jhal Muri

First finely chop veggies like onion, tomato, boiled potato, cucumber, ginger and green chilies. You can even mince the onions and ginger. 
Keep them aside. 
Making Jhal Muri
Heat a kadai and keep flame to a low or medium-low. Add 2 cups of puffed rice (murmura).
Stirring often roast for 2 to 3 minutes or more till they become crisp and crunchy.
Check a few puffed rice and they should be crunchy and not soft or chewy.

Switch off the flame and keep the pan down. One by one add all the spice powders from the above list of "Spice powders". Also add black salt and rock salt or regular salt as per taste. 
The heat from the pan will roast the spice powders and make them aromatic. If the puffed rice you are using are already crisp and crunchy then just roast them for some seconds or a minute. Keep the pan down and then add the spice powders.
Mix puffed rice with the spice powders. Let this puffed rice cool at room temperature before you begin with the next step.
Add ¼ cup roasted peanuts. 
Next add the finely chopped onions, tomatoes, potatoes, green chilies and ginger.

Drizzle 1 teaspoon mustard oil all over.
Next drizzle 1 teaspoon lemon juice all over.
Gently mix again.
Add sev. Instead of sev you can also add chana chur (savory mixture like chiwda).
Add coriander leaves. Mix quickly. Check taste and add more salt, lemon juice or any of the spice powders if you want.
Serve jhal muri straight away.
