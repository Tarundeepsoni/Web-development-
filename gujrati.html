	     <div><img src="images/khandvi.jpg"></div>  
	      	<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>besan – 1/2 cup</li>
<li>Buttermilk – 2 cups</li>
<li>Ginger paste – 1/2 tsp</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>Turmeric powder – 1/2 tsp</li>
<li>Oil –  1 tsp</li>
<li>Mustard seeds – 1/2 tsp
<li>Sesame seeds – 1/2 tsp</li>
<li>Green chili – 1</li>
<li>Grated coconut and chopped coriander for garnishing</li>
          </ul>
           <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins><br></h3>
          
          	1. First prep up all the ingredients required. Take the yogurt in a bowl. You can use dairy or vegan yogurt.<br>

<h4>making khandvi batter</h4>

2. Add water and stir well.<br>


3. Add ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder, asafoetida and salt. If using fresh yogurt, then to add the sourness, add about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice.<br>

4. Add the gram flour aka besan.<br>



5. With a wired whisk, keep on stirring and mixing till all the lumps are dissolved and you get a smooth batter.<br>

<h4>khandvi batter</h4>
6. Pour this batter in a saucepan or a broad frying pan. Switch on the stovetop and keep the flame to the lowest. Begin to stir.<br>


7. Spread oil on plates or boards or tray. Large steel lids or thalis work very well. You can also use the back of a large baking tray. I had to use 4 steel lids. A suggestion would be to use your kitchen counter top, if you prefer. Then you just spread the whole cooked batter on it and can spread it in your own pace. A large wooden or metal tray would also be good.<br>
plates for putting khandvi batter<br>
8. Also mix the chopped coriander leaves and grated coconut. Keep aside.<br>


9. Keep on stirring when the khandvi batter is getting heated up. Lumps begin to form and you have to continuously stir so that the lumps don’t form.<br>
10. The batter would thicken and keep on thickening. Keep on stirring. Best to use a wooden spatula or a heat proof silicon spatula.<br>
11. You will see the khandvi batter has thickened more than the previous pic.<br>
12. Stir & stir and exercise your hands. the batter also should not be allowed to stick at the bottom. So you have to stir continuously.<br>
13. A well thickened batter and looks like we are ready.<br>
14. So I just spread a few teaspoons of the batter on a greased lid. As you see the texture is still wet.<br>

<h4>checking batter - Gujarati khandvi recipe</h4>

15. Once the spread batter cooled a bit, I tried rolling. As you see the rolls could not be formed. The batter was still pasty, sticky and not properly set.<br>
16. So the batter needs to be cooked more.<br>
making khandvi batter
17. Continue to stir.<br>


18. This is the Final consistency of the khandvi batter. it took me 17 minutes to get the correct consistency on a low flame. The timing will vary depending on the intensity of the flame, the thickness/thinness of the pan and the size of the pan. Just do the plate test and when you can form the rolls, then the khandvi batter is ready. If the batter becomes too thick, then it becomes difficult to spread and you don’t get thin layers in the rolls. In this case, still spread the batter. You will get thick slices, but still they taste good.<br>


19. Tested again and this time the rolls were happening. This time the batter had spread evenly and there is a smoothness in the layers as well as in the spread batter.
<br>


<h4>Making khandvi rolls</h4>
20. Quickly pour about ½ to ⅔ cup of batter on a large plate and spread thinly & evenly with a spatula. You have to be quick with the remaining batter too. Since even a bit of cooling and the batter becomes likes blob, difficult to spread. If you use a large tray or a parat, then its much easier as you don’t hurry like a harried woman here and there.<br>

21. Allow to cool and then sprinkle the coconut + coriander leaves mixture sparingly. You can also skip this stuffing part and directly garnish with the coconut and coriander once you temper the khandvi rolls.<br>
22. Cut into equal sized strips.<br>
23. Gently roll each strip tightly. Then place them in a serving tray or plate next to each other or stack them neatly. If the tray or plate is large, then you will get large khandvi rolls. In this case after you finish rolling half,  just cut horizontally and make a second roll.<br>

<h4>Tempering for khandvi</h4>
24. For the tempering, heat oil and crackle the mustard seeds.<br>
25. Then add curry leaves, green chilies and fry for a few seconds.<br>
26. Add the sesame seeds and then when they change color & crackle.<br>
27. Pour this hot tempering mixture along with the oil on the khandvi rolls.<br>

28. You can garnish it with some more coconut and coriander leaves, if you prefer. Serve khandvi with coriander chutney or coriander mint chutney.

          </ul>
           <h3><ins>Steps to cook</ins><br></h3>
          <ul>
          	1. In a bowl or parat (large plate with rims at the sides) take 1 cup besan (gram flour).<br>

2. Add ¼ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain), 10 to 12 black pepper (crushed coarsely), ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder and 1 pinch asafoetida (hing). Also add ⅛ teaspoon baking soda or 2 to 3 pinches of baking soda.<br>

3. Mix very well with a spoon.<br>
4. Now add ¾ teaspoon salt or add as per taste.<br>
5. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water in parts.<br>
6. Begin to mix the water with the besan.<br>
7. Then knead to a tight dough.<br>
8. Now add 2 tablespoons oil.<br>
9. Mix again and continue to knead. Also add water if required. Initially i added 3 tablespoons water and after adding oil, added 1 tablespoon water. So in total I added 4 tablespoons water. Depending on the quality of besan, you can add a total of 3 to 4 tablespoons of water.<br>
10. Continue to knead till all the water is absorbed.<br>
11. When the water is absorbed, the stickiness will go away and you will get soft dough. So knead till you get a soft smooth dough. Cover and keep aside the dough for 30 minutes.<br>
<b>Rolling fafda</b><br>
12. After 30 minutes, make small balls from the dough. Cover them with a lid or a kitchen towel so that they do not become dry.<br>

13. On a wooden board spread oil very lightly. Keep one besan dough ball on the lightly greased wooden tray or board. Do not grease board with much oil as then the fafda cannot be pressed easily. Spread some oil on your hands if you want, before starting the next step.<br>
14. Now with the heels of your palms, with a light pressure and force, press and flatten the dough ball and at the same time move the palms forward. Keep equal pressure throughout but do not put a lot of pressure. If you apply too much pressure then fafda will stick to board and will break while lifting. This is the only tricky part in the whole recipe. you need to apply light pressure as well as move further while pressing and flattening the fafda dough.<br>

15. You will get a long elongated shaped fafda. Gently pick it up from the board. Also do not make fafda too thin as then it cannot be lifted easily. You can also lift fafda with a knife or spatula. An alternate method is to roll a large piece of dough with a rolling pin (belan) on a greased rolling board (chakla). Then with a knife cut strips and remove them.<br>

16. Keep it on a separate plate or board which has been greased lightly with oil. Make them this way with the remaining dough balls. Cover with kitchen napkin so that they do not become dry.<br>

<b>Frying fafda</b><br>
17. Heat oil in a kadai. When the oil becomes medium hot, check a small tiny piece of the dough. It should gradually come up on top of the oil.<br>
18. Now reduce the flame to low-medium. Add the fafda pieces gently in the oil.
<br>
19. Do not overcrowd the kadai. Depending on the size of the kadai, you can add 3 to 4 pieces at a time.<br>

20. Begin to fry at a low-medium flame.<br>
21. When one side is crisp and golden, then with a slotted spoon gently turn over each fafda and continue to fry.<br>
22. Turn over again and fry till crisp. Do not fry till too much browned. Fafda gets fried quickly, so the frying needs attention.<br>

23. Remove with a slotted spoon draining excess oil.<br>
24. Place them on kitchen paper towels for extra oil to be absorbed. In the same way fry the remaining batches.<br>
25. Serve fafda warm or at room temperature with papaya sambharo or fafda chutney or Gujarati.

<h4>Preparation For Suji Ka Halwa</h4><br>

<li>Crush the green cardamom seeds to a fine powder in a mortar-pestle and keep aside. Remove the husks</li>
<li>Keep a kadai or pan on a low flame.</li>
<li>Add the ghee and when the ghee is heating up, do the following.</li>
<li>Take the sugar and water in another pan.</li>
<li>Keep this pan on a medium to high flame and let the sugar solution come to a boil.</li>
<li>Once the ghee becomes hot, add the suji (semolina) & cashews and stir.</li>
<li>Keep on stirring the suji (semolina) so that the grains does not stick to the pan and are fried evenly.</li>

<li>Meanwhile keep your attention on the sugar solution also.</li>
<li>If the mixture starts to boil, then lower the flame and let it simmer.</li>
<li>Keep on frying & stirring the semolina for 7 to 8 mins till the grains change their color and when the cashews also change to a light golden or golden.</li>
<li>Then add the cardamom powder, chironji, raisins and edible camphor (optional). Mix very well.</li>
<h4>Making Suji Ka Halwa Or Sheera</h4><br>
<li>Stir and then add the bubbling hot sugar solution slowly to the fried suji mixture.</li>

<li>Be careful as the mixture has the tendency to splutter.</li>
<li>Be quick enough to stir. The sooji will begin to absorb the water and swell.</li>
<li>Keep on stirring often till the whole mixture starts thickening and starts to leave the edges of the kadai or pan.</li>
<li>Serve sooji halwa or sheera hot or warm or when cooled at room temperature</li>

<li>Cover and keep aside the bajra dough for 30 minutes or for a couple of hours.</li>
<li>Make small to medium sized balls from the dough.</li>
<li>Rub little water in your palms and shape each ball into a vada or patty. The patty should not be thick or thin. About 1/8 of an inch. Thinner than an aloo tikki.</li>
<h4>Frying Bajra Vada</h4><br>
<li>Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.</li>
<li>Gently slid the vada in the hot oil. The oil should be medium hot.</li>
<li>Prepare more vadas and add them to the oil.</li>

<li>When one side is half done, turn over and fry the other side.</li>
<li>Fry them till golden and remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
<li>Place on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
<li>Serve bajra vada hot or warm. Accompany the vadas with fresh or spiced curd/yogurt or with evening chai. </li>
<li>These bajra vada stay good for a week too and also can be made as a picnic or travel snack.</li>

          <ol>
<h4>Making Chilla Batter</h4><br>

<li>Take the gram flour in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Add the onions, tomatoes, ginger, green chillies ground spices, carom seeds, coriander leaves and salt</li>
<li>First add ½ cup water and with a wired whisk begin to mix.</li>
<li>If the batter looks thick, then add 1 to 3 tablespoons more water. Depending on the quality and texture of besan, you can add less or more water.</li>
<li>Mix to a smooth flowing consistency in the batter. Break lumps if any while mixing batter.</li>
<h4>Cooking Besan Chilla</h4><br>
<li>Heat a frying pan or a skillet on a low to medium-low heat. You can use an iron skillet or a non-stick pan. If using iron skillet or tawa, then spread a bit of oil on it.</li>

<li>Let the pan become medium hot. Then take a ladle full of the batter and pour on the pan
Gently with the back of the ladle, begin to spread the batter.</li>
<li>Spread lightly and gently so that the cheela does not break.</li>
<li>On a low flame cook the chilla till the top begins to look cooked.</li>
<li>Then drizzle ½ to 1 teaspoon oil on the chilla at the edges and all around.</li>
<li>Continue to cook till the base gets light golden.</li>
<li>Flip and now cook the other side.</li>
<li>Cook this side until you see golden spots on the besan chilla.</li>
<li>Fold and serve chilla hot or warm. Besan chilla are best had hot. But if you are not able to serve them hot, then place them in a roti basket or casserole. They remain warm and can be served later.</li>
