		<h3>what our website do.?</h3>
		The best way for you to get started is by searching for a recipe. You can also just search for an ingredient name in the search bar, whatever youâ€™d like to cook or bake with at the moment. The category links on the sidebar work great too so feel free to use that to dive into a particular group of recipes you may be interested in.<br><br><br><br>

I am not very good at concocting recipes on my own. Of course, I do one odd dish here and there but most of my recipes are borrowed and adapted or inspired from another source. I am very particular about giving due credit (and I expect the same in return, thank you very much). If I try one of your recipes, I will mention that and link to you if you have a site. If you still have a problem with me doing that, please let me know and I will keep your awesome recipe to myself.<br><br><br><br>

All recipes are tried and tested in my kitchen unless otherwise mentioned.<br><br><br>

Oh and also, use all recipes as a guideline. Food is a very personal thing and my tastes are almost definitely going to be different from yours. Use your discretion when you add, subtract, and substitute ingredients. If you are absolutely new to cooking and what you make looks nothing like the pictures I have posted, I am going to safely assume you did something wrong. Cooking takes practice and patience.<br><br><br><br>

<b>Photography</b><br><br><br>
I currently use a Nikon D7100 with a 50mm 1.8D prime lens or the 60mm Nikkor macro lens for all my food pictures. The 18-105mm that came with the camera is my last choice but its width is great for outdoor shots so I bear with it.
<br><br><br><br>
Although I am in no way a professional photographer, I like to pretend like I am one and know a lot. You can read my posts on Food Photography Basics to learn more. I know the bare minimum to take basic pictures and I thought you may want to read up on that<br><br>
